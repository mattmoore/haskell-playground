# Books

Books is an example program in Haskell demonstrating certain concepts of functional programming with Haskell, especially with data transformations.

This example also demonstrates the use of Haskell's type classes. Many typed languages offer function overloading&mdash;the ability to have a function behave polymorphically (define behavior for multiple input types). In Haskell, this is achieved via type classes.
